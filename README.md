## Backend Assignment for Convergence Concepts
### Requirements:
* Use Node.js
* A User should be able to create "todo" items, which can be viewed (read) by all users.
* Only the owner of a todo item can update or delete a todo item
* A user can use the REST API to search to-do items by different filters. (e.g. description, category - up to you)
* A login endpoint with simple authentication logic
* Validation and error handling where it is considered appropriate

### Notes: 
* The API does not actually need to be deployed or hosted; the code is sufficient
* It may be easiest to simply share a public GitHub repo URL
* The DB layer will be assumed to exist (it also does not need to be running)
* A "todo" entity can be whatever you want it to be. The back end can be as simple as you consider appropriate.

### Bonus:
* Use GraphQL
* Database connection/configuration setup (DB engine of choice - again, no hosted DB is expected to be provided)

# Backend Assignment for Convergence Concepts

## Description:
The objective of the exercise is not about complexity, scale, or the amount of code written. The exercise is about readability, organization, decisions made, and overall project structure. Any libraries that you would use in a real-world project are certainly OK to use - it is not an 'algorithm exam'!

### Requirements:
1. Use Node.js
2. A User should be able to create "todo" items, which can be viewed (read) by all users.
3. Only the owner of a todo item can update or delete a todo item
4. A user can use the REST API to search to-do items by different filters. (e.g. description, category - up to you)
5. A login endpoint with simple authentication logic
6. Validation and error handling where it is considered appropriate

### Notes: 
1. The API does not actually need to be deployed or hosted; the code is sufficient
2. It may be easiest to simply share a public GitHub repo URL
3. The DB layer will be assumed to exist (it also does not need to be running)
4. A "todo" entity can be whatever you want it to be. The back end can be as simple as you consider appropriate.

### Bonus:
1. Use GraphQL
2. Database connection/configuration setup (DB engine of choice - again, no hosted DB is expected to be provided)
